> This material was originally posted [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management). It is reproduced here for posterities sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
Pack Rat
## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
For backpackers who like to keep their gear organized and their packs light. 
## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

Pack Rat is for light and ultra-light backpackers who want to be able to pack for any trip at any time. Enter all your items into your 'gear closet' with the type, category, and weight and then create packs for different situations (seasons, individual trips, etc). Pack Rat will tell you the weight of your pack as you pack it, so you don't even have to get out the scale. Additionally, Pack Rat will give you access to a community where you can view other backpackers packs to see where you can save weight in your own setup and show off just how light you've made your load. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

Packing for backpacking trips can be difficult, especially for longer trips where a light pack is beneficial. Packing, weighing your pack, then adding or removing items can be time consuming and updating your gear list with spreadsheets can be tedious. The items you pack depend on the season, location, and duration of your trip, so the gear you bring won't be the same for every trip. There is also a community of backpackers who are forever striving to decrease their pack weight who would be interested in comparing their gear set-up with other backpackers and share their opinions on the gear they own. Currently, backpackinglight forums are the best source of information, but they are relatively difficult to navigate and search.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

Pack Rat allows you to keep a master list of your gear and make gear lists for individual trips or situations. As you 'pack' your pack, Pack Rat displays the total weight so you know how heavy your pack will be before you physically pack it. Reference the packs you've saved so packing for that next trip will be fast. You can also look at other user's packs and see where you might easily cut weight in your own pack. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  Pack Rat makes packing fast and easy, whether your trip is a weekend overnight or a month-long thru hike. Slim down your pack, increase your miles, up the adventure. 

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

After you sign up, begin by entering the gear you own and each item's weight into your 'gear closet'. As soon as you've done that you can start packing packs with just a click. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Pack Rat made it easy to prepare for backpacking trips. I can just reference a gear list that worked in the past, pull those items out of my closet, and pack my pack without worrying about the weight or leaving essential items behind. It's also really easy to see where I can save some weight by upgrading my gear. I noticed which of my items were heavy compared to other light backpacker's and put those gear upgrades on my wishlist. So far, I reduced my pack weight by 2 lbs by just upgrading my tent and I hope to reduce it by another 2 lbs by next season."
